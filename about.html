<h1>About Me</h1>
<br>

<p>I’m a UX/UI designer with a background in Fine Art and experience in professional kitchens. 

My journey began at the Michaelis School of Fine Art, where I developed a strong eye for aesthetics, detail, and visual composition. These skills now inform my approach to user experience and interface design. I care about creating products that are beautiful, intuitive, inclusive, and meaningful. 

My approach combines research and hands-on work. I discover real needs, structure experiences, design clearly, prototype quickly, and validate with users and stakeholders. I'm comfortable moving from messy insights to organized information, from wireframes to high-fidelity UI, and making changes based on evidence. 

Before working in design, I was in professional kitchens. I developed a keen eye for detail and a focus on quality service that drives customer satisfaction. I now bring this mindset into UX/UI. Currently, I'm training at XDi Academy to sharpen my skills in user research, UI design, wireframing, prototyping, accessibility basics, information architecture, usability testing, and building real-world projects that showcase these skills. I am particularly interested in work that supports social impact and empowers users through thoughtful systems. I'm open to collaboration, freelance projects, or junior design roles where I can learn, contribute, and deliver polished, usable interfaces. </p>
